# Torq Lang

Welcome to the Torq Programming Language for Java developers.

Big Data analytics, artificial intelligence, and IT/OT convergence are pressuring organizations to be data-centric. The urgent need to manage explosive data growth with meaning, where billions of files and records are distributed over thousands of computers, is a significant challenge.

Torq addresses these challenges by simplifying data-centric programming at scale with a novel programming model. This allows programmers to focus on the application problem rather than the programming problem, leading to efficiencies that lower costs.

The Torq programming model is designed to improve scalability, responsiveness, and faster time-to-market in three problem areas:

1. Data contextualization - enhancing live data meaningfully before it is stored
2. Enterprise convergence - composing meaningful APIs across departments and divisions
3. Situational applications - creating low-cost, low-code, highly-valued applications quickly

    <dt>Data contextualization</dt>
    <dd>Modern data fuels analytics and artificial intelligence. To make data specifically meaningful, it needs preprocessing, contextualization, and additional features before reaching storage. Torq enhances existing dataflows efficiently with related data to help reveal insights that would otherwise go unseen.</dd>
    <dt>Enterprise convergence</dt>
    <dd>Enterprise workflows require applications spanning multiple departments and divisions. Initiatives, such as the "Unified Name Space," aim to tear down traditional silos. Torq provides a dynamic platform to unify the enterprise with composable services that integrate departments and divisions.</dd>
    <dt>Situational applications</dt>
    <dd>Recent advancements have enabled solutions that were out of reach only a few years ago, creating a massive demand for new solutions. Low-code platforms help citizen developers reduce software backlogs. Torq is a truly low-code platform that scales and executes efficiently.</dd>

Torq is a dynamic, structurally typed, concurrent programming language with novel ease-of-use and efficiency.
